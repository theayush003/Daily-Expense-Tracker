Daily Expense Tracker - Java Project
Project Overview
The Daily Expense Tracker is a Java-based application designed to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently. Users can log expenses, categorize them (e.g., food, travel, utilities), and view summarized reports for specific time periods such as a day, week, or month. The application stores all expense data in a text file, allowing users to retrieve and review their expense history at any time.

This project is an excellent introduction to real-world programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, and User Input Management.

Key Features
Add Expenses: Log expenses by specifying the amount, category, and a short description.

View Summaries: View total expenses for:

A day

A week

A month

Save Data: All expense records are stored in a text file (expenses.txt) for future reference.

View All Expenses: Display all logged expenses in a readable format.

Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language used for development.

File I/O: For saving and loading expense data to/from a text file.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, classes, and methods for clean and modular code.

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a terminal to compile and run the program.

Steps to Run:

Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Compile and run the Main.java file.

Follow the on-screen menu to add expenses, view summaries, or exit the program.

File Storage:

All expenses are saved in a file named expenses.txt in the project directory.

The file is automatically created if it doesn't exist.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following classes:

Expense.java:

Represents a single expense with attributes like amount, category, and description.

Includes a toString() method for easy printing of expense details.

ExpenseManager.java:

Manages the list of expenses.

Provides functionalities like adding expenses, viewing summaries, and saving/loading data to/from a file.

Main.java:

The entry point of the application.

Displays a menu for user interaction and calls appropriate methods from ExpenseManager.

Code Example
Adding an Expense
java
Copy
ExpenseManager expenseManager = new ExpenseManager();
expenseManager.addExpense(25.50, "Food", "Lunch at Cafe");
Viewing All Expenses
java
Copy
expenseManager.viewAllExpenses();
Viewing a Summary
java
Copy
expenseManager.viewSummary("week");
Future Enhancements
Date Tracking: Add a date field to each expense for better tracking.

Filtering: Implement filtering by category or date range.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Use Java Swing or JavaFX to create a user-friendly interface.

Data Analysis: Provide insights like average daily expenses or category-wise spending trends.

Tips for Success
Plan Your Code: Before coding, identify the necessary classes, methods, and their interactions.

Start Simple: Implement basic features first (e.g., adding expenses) before moving to advanced functionalities.

Test Incrementally: Test each feature as you implement it to ensure smooth functionality.

Organize Your Code: Use meaningful variable and method names for readability and maintainability.
